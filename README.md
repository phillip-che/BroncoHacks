## Project Overview
This project was developed during the **2024 BroncoHacks hackathon** by a team of passionate developers. Over a 24-hour period, we created a dynamic web application designed for **Cal Poly Pomona students** to buy and sell items on campus. The application allows users to:

- Create an account and log in securely.
- Post items for sale with details such as title, description, price, and images.
- Browse item listings with a user-friendly interface.
- Search for items using filters like category, price range, and location.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure account creation and login functionality.
- **Item Listings**: Display all posted items in a clean, responsive layout.
- **Search and Filters**: Users can search for items and apply filters to narrow down results.
- **Post Items**: Easy-to-use form for posting new items for sale.
